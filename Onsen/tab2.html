                    <ons-col style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px">   22 years ago, the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, was executed. However, before his death he revealed to everyone that his treasure, the One Piece, was hidden at the end of the Grand Line. This inspired people to become pirates and sail toward the treasure, beginning the Great Age of Pirates. Twelve years later, a young boy from the East Blue named Monkey D. Luffy dreamed of finding the One Piece, but lost the ability to swim after eating a Devil Fruit giving him the ability to stretch his body like rubber. He was given a straw hat by the pirate Shanks, who would later go on to become an Emperor, one of the four most powerful pirates in the world, on the agreement that he would return the hat once he became a pirate and surpassed Shanks.
